# Flowbar: Project Context & User Stories

## Core Mission

To build a "Calm Engine" that helps users find and protect their most valuable mental state: "flow." We are an antidote to the jarring, interruption-driven nature of traditional productivity tools.

## Core User Stories (MVP V1)

- **US1:** As a user, I want an ambient, visual indicator of my current work state (focus/break) so I am not startled by alarms.
- **US2:** As a user, I want to easily start and stop focus/break sessions from my browser toolbar.
- **US3:** As a user, I want to configure the duration of my focus and break periods to match my personal workflow.
- **US4:** As a user, I want a gentle, visual warning when I navigate to a self-defined "distraction" website during a focus session.
- **US5:** As a user, I want a subtle visual cue that my focus session is ending soon, so I can finish my thought.

## Non-Negotiable Requirements

- **Must be calm and non-intrusive:** No audible alarms or jarring pop-ups by default.
- **UI must be minimal and beautiful:** Every pixel should serve a purpose and feel serene.
- **Must be reliable:** The timer logic must be robust and persist across browser sessions.
- **Must be private:** The extension should require the absolute minimum necessary permissions.

## Success Metrics for MVP

- Ship a stable, polished V1 within the 30-day #BuildInPublic challenge.
- Receive positive, qualitative feedback from the developer and productivity communities.
- Achieve 100+ installs in the first month post-launch.
