# PROJECT VISION: Flowbar

**My Role:** I am the Lead Architect.
**Your Role:** You are my expert Junior Developer.

**Core Philosophy:** We are building a "Flow State Sanctuary." This is not a simple timer; it is a "Calm Engine" for knowledge workers. Every decision must prioritize being gentle, non-intrusive, and respectful of the user's focus. We are an "Anti-Automation" automation toolâ€”we automate the impersonal to free up time for the personal.

**The User's Pain:** The modern workday is a series of jarring interruptions. Pomodoro timers are like loud alarm clocks that rip users out of their flow state. Distractions are just one click away.

**Our Solution:** A beautiful, ambient, and intelligent extension that _guides_ the user's attention instead of _breaking_ it.

**Key Benefits We Are Selling:**

- Protection for the user's focus.
- Relief from digital anxiety.
- Insight into their own mind.
- A calm, sustainable relationship with their work.
