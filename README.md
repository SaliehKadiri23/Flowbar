# Flowbar: A Calm Engine for Deep Work

Flowbar is a Chrome extension designed to help you find, maintain, and protect your most valuable mental state: **flow**. It acts as a "Calm Engine," replacing jarring alarms and abrupt interruptions with a gentle, ambient, and intelligent guide for your attention.

We believe that productivity tools shouldn't be another source of anxiety. Flowbar is an antidote to the constant digital noise, helping you cultivate a more serene and sustainable relationship with your work.

## Core Philosophy

Our mission is to build a "Flow State Sanctuary." Every feature is designed to be:

-   **Calm & Non-Intrusive:** No audible alarms or startling pop-ups by default. We use subtle visual cues to guide you.
-   **Minimal & Beautiful:** A clean, serene interface where every pixel serves a purpose.
-   **Reliable & Private:** The timer logic is robust and persists across sessions, and the extension requires the absolute minimum necessary permissions.

## Features (MVP)

-   **Ambient Visual Indicator:** A subtle border in your browser window indicates your current state (Focus, Break, or Wind-Down) without startling you.
-   **Effortless Control:** Easily start, stop, and manage your sessions directly from the browser toolbar.
-   **Configurable Timers:** Set your own preferred durations for focus and break periods to match your personal rhythm.
-   **Focus Sanctuary:** When you navigate to a distracting site during a focus session, a gentle overlay asks, "Is this where you want to be?" giving you a mindful choice.
-   **Gentle Wind-Down:** A subtle visual transition cues you that your focus session is nearing its end, allowing you to wrap up your thoughts without being jolted out of the zone.
