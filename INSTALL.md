# How to Install Flowbar

There are two ways to install the Flowbar extension: for development and for general use. Follow the guide that best suits your needs.

## 1. For Developers (or Beta Testers)

This method, often called "sideloading," allows you to run the extension directly from the source code on your local machine. This is ideal for development, testing, or using the latest unreleased version.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download the Code:**
    *   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/flowbar-extension.git
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can download the source code as a `.zip` file from GitHub and extract it.

2.  **Open Chrome Extensions Page:**
    *   Launch your Google Chrome browser.
    *   Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.

3.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    *   In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, find the **"Developer mode"** toggle and switch it **on**.

4.  **Load the Extension:**
    *   Three new buttons will appear: "Load unpacked," "Pack extension," and "Update."
    *   Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
    *   A file selection dialog will open. Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the `flowbar-extension` source code and select the entire folder.

5.  **Done!**
    *   The Flowbar extension should now appear in your list of extensions. You can pin it to your toolbar for easy access.
